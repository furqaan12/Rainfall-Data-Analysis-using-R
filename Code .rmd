## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# create a vector for rainfall amounts
```{r}
rainfall <- c(0.1,0.6,33.8,1.9,9.6,4.3,33.7,0.3,0.0,0.1)
```

# calculate the mean and standard deviation
```{r}
mean_rainfall <- mean(rainfall)
sd_rainfall <- sd(rainfall)
print(mean(rainfall))
print(sd(rainfall))
```

# display the cumulative rainfall
```{r}
cum_rainfall <- cumsum(rainfall)
cum_rainfall
```

# find the day with the highest and lowest rainfall
```{r}
max_rainfall_day <- which.max(rainfall)
min_rainfall_day <- which.min(rainfall)
print(max_rainfall_day)
print(min_rainfall_day)
```

```{r}
cat("Day with highest rainfall:", max_rainfall_day, "\n")
cat("Day with lowest rainfall:", min_rainfall_day)
```
# create a vector of 20 random letters from the alphabet
```{r}
rand_letters <- sample(LETTERS, 20, replace = TRUE)
sort(rand_letters)
```

# create a 10 x 10 matrix with random numbers
```{r}
mat <- matrix(runif(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
print(mat)
```

# calculate the column means and standard deviation
```{r}
col_means <- colMeans(mat)
col_sd <- apply(mat, 2, sd)
print(col_means)
print(col_sd)
```

# create a matrix with 100 columns and 10 rows
```{r}
mat2 <- matrix(runif(1000), nrow = 10, ncol = 100)
print(mat2)
```
# calculate the column means and plot a histogram
```{r}
col_means2 <- colMeans(mat2)
hist(col_means2)
```

# create another matrix with 1000 columns and 10 rows
```{r}
mat3 <- matrix(runif(10000), nrow = 10, ncol = 1000)
print(mat3)
```
# calculate the column means and plot a histogram
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
col_means3 <- colMeans(mat3)

```

# read the rainfall data from problem 1
```{r}
rainfall <- c(0.1,0.6,33.8,1.9,9.6,4.3,33.7,0.3,0.0,0.1)
```

# subset of data where rainfall is larger than 20
```{r}
rainfall_subset <- rainfall[rainfall > 20]
print(rainfall_subset)
```

# mean rainfall for days where rainfall was at least 4
```{r}
mean_rainfall_subset <- mean(rainfall[rainfall >= 4])
print(mean_rainfall_subset)
```

# subset where rainfall is either 0 or 0.6
```{r}
rainfall_subset2 <- rainfall[rainfall == 0 | rainfall == 0.6]
print(rainfall_subset2)
```
